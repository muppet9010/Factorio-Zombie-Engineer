# Zombie Engineer



When the engineer dies, their corpse rises again and it's not happy!



Features
-----------

- When a player dies their corpse rises again as a zombie, holding all of the player's equipment.
- The zombie is a slow moving, strong enemy that attacks in melee.
- Zombies move in straight lines to their target, destroying all in their path.
- Zombies won't be attacked by the players defences or weapons automatically. The player must specifically target the zombie and shoot it (C).AI picture recognition may have a flaw after all as they can't distinguish the zombie from the player.
- There are optional graves (mod setting) that can be added to the map that when destroyed will release a zombie.
