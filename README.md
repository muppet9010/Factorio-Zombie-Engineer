# Zombie Engineer



When the engineer dies, their corpse rises again and it's not happy!



# ALPHA RELEASE
## This is a early release version of the mod. It doesn't truly reflect the planned state, but was done for an initial play-through.



Features
-----------

- When a player dies their corpse rises again as a zombie, holding all of the player's equipment.
- The zombie is a slow moving, strong enemy that attacks in melee. Zombies are immune to most effects.
- Zombies won't be attacked by the player's turret defences. The turret's AI seems to have a flaw distinguishing your concious controlled body from your old animated zombie bodies. Players, other units, combat robots and vehicles will auto target them.
- There are optional graves (mod setting) that can be added to the map that when destroyed will release a zombie.



Known Limitations
-----------------

other mods in general are likely not compatible. The mod is designed around the needs of a multiplayer play-through by the Twitch streamer JD-Plays and may not be suitable as a general use mod. As such mod compatibility is not a priority.

- It only handles the vanilla forces; player and enemy.
- It only handles vanilla character graphics.
- The special zombie pathing only handles vanilla entities and tiles for zombie pathing, plus my Biter Eggs mod. Meaning Zombies will potentially try to walk through other friendly modded entities and then awkwardly path around them at the last minute.
- Slowdown capsule restriction only affects vanilla slowdown capsule.
