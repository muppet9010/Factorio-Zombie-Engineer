Version: 1.0.6
Date: 2024-01-14
  Features:
  Changes:
    - Player corpse line now distinguishes between the "best" armor zombie/corpse and any other zombie/corpses. The best armor is based on equipment grid size, then total power generation/storage/usage.
  Bugfixes:
    - FIXED: When a player has lines to zombie/corpses and they leave and rejoin the server they don't have the lines any more. Once they next die they then get lines to the new and all previous zombie/corpses, then inventory size bonus, and finally the oldest zombie/corpse.

Version: 1.0.5
Date: 2023-12-28
  Features:
    - Mod settings to control zombies health, movement speed, attack damage and to enable turrets to attack zombies (off by default).
  Changes:
    - Zombie health, damage reductions and healing rate are all defined from the armor type they wear. This is on an offset scale to try and keep some balance between expected player weapons and the armors they may wear.
