-- FUTURE: does this have to be final fixes, or can it just be in data-fixes. Also do we have to require AngryBiters or can we just rely on the later dat stage to deal with it?
require("data-final-fixes.angry-biters-mod")
require("data-final-fixes.apply-zombie-trigger-target-mask")
require("data-final-fixes.apply-zombie-path-collision-mask")
