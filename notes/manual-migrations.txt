MANUAL SCRIPTS TO MIGRATE DEATHS ACROSS INTO THIS MOD
----------------------------

This will write out to in-game text an entry for each player's death captured by the Death Counter mod.

/sc __Death_Counter__
local deathCounts = {}
for playerName, playerDetails in pairs(global.players) do
    local totalCount = 0
    for _, thisCount in pairs(playerDetails.DeathCount) do
        totalCount = totalCount + thisCount
    end
    local playerIndex;
    for _, player in pairs(game.players) do
        if player.name == playerName then
            playerIndex = player.index
            break
        end
    end
    if playerIndex ~= nil then
        --[[game.player.print(playerIndex .. " = " .. totalCount)]]
        deathCounts[playerIndex] = totalCount
    else
        game.player.print("can't find player index for name: " .. playerName)
    end
end
local updateDeathCountString = ""
for playerIndex, totalCount in pairs(deathCounts) do
    updateDeathCountString = updateDeathCountString .. playerIndex .. " = "..totalCount.."   ---   "
end
game.player.print(updateDeathCountString)



This will set the death count in the zombie mod for this Player Index to the provided current death count.

/sc __zombie_engineer__
local playerIndex = 1
local deathCount = 3
global.ZombieEngineerManager.playerDeathCounts[playerIndex] = deathCount
