Bugs/Next
---------
- Move the zombie pathfinder stuff to its own class file. As the main zombie engineer one is getting a bit full with the other random stuff.
- The player line to body is running in a safety handler of code. So it will just log an error message and continue, rather than hard crash. After it runs ok for a stream remove this safety wrapper. `-- FUTURE: run it all in a safety bubble.`


Required
--------
+ When player dies a zombie is created. The zombie gets the players inventory (meaning their corpse vanishes).
+ A zombie will have high health, be slow, and have a very high damage attack.
+ A zombie will be a `unit` and given explicit direct commands. It won't have any default behavior or reactions. We can't use generic behaviours, but should be able to do desired effect via explicit commands.
- A zombie should move towards the nearest player if they are within X distance. This will need regular updating to both handle players running away fast (e.g. trains) and if the player moves the zombie will need to re-path towards their new position.
- A zombie should move towards the dead player's spawn if there is no near by player to target.
- If a zombie reaches within X distance of spawn it should then just target random player entities until a player comes within the detection range.
- A zombie should path towards its target smashing through anything in its direct way. The configurable options per pathfinder request are restricted within Factorio (to avoid affecting default biters). Doing a pathfinder request with a special entity that ignores player entities will give the desired result path steps. We can then find the first target entity in the path and give our unit this as a target. The aim is to not slalom around buildings which the Factorio pathfinder will do by default.
+ When a zombie is killed it should leave a corpse behind with all of the items it had within it.
+ Stop the angry biters mod replacing our zombie when its health drops. Remove the angry prototype that mod creates and this stops it.
+ A zombie should be immune to belts.
+ Zombies are not shootable by turrets, but will still be auto targetted by players, other units, combat robots and vehicles. This is due to it being very hard to force shoot at a target in the latency state.
+ Make gravestones be auto added to the map. Frequency controlled via mod setting just like Biter Eggs mod is.
+ Make gravestones spawn a zombie when mined/destroyed.
+ Main zombie logic runs in an error catching manner. This may lead to broken zombies and error spam until the offending zombie is removed via Editor. But it will stop hard errors from crashing the server. Suitable in this case as the state of the zombie doesn't really matter to the wider play-through.
- Test the various error messages are reached and in non-testing mode don't raise any hard errors in-game.
- Try doing a STOP command on a zombie for infinite time. See if that makes HasCommand() return negative. Might be better also than checking for the wander state.
- Add a thumbnail to the mod.



Nice To Have
------------
- Equip the players inventory for passive stuff to be active, e.g. power armor, legs, shields, regular armor resistances.
+ Name the zombie after the player and their death number.
+ When a player is killed by a zombie have an alert text and link to location saying who was killed by what zombie. As default Factorio would just list it as killed by zombie entity name.
+ When a player kills a zombie, add an announcement that they have put the source player to rest.
+ Add a line from the player to their zombie/it's corpse if it dies. Include a per player mod setting to control if this is shown or not. Also the line's thickness.
+ Name a grave generated zombie after a list of names. Have a mod setting to define these for now.
- Add graphical effects to zombie so it stands out. Maybe odd colors, cloud of effects around it, etc.
- Zombies able able to use player weapons to shoot other players, vehicles, combat robots? Should always be a melee attack on buildings. Make mod setting to disable this. Will need to be a scripted attack as we can't change the units attack properties dynamically and replacing the entity based on weapon/ammo types would likely have unintended consequences. When shooting the zombie should have a temporary speed reduction like the player does.
- Zombie's generate slow down and poison effects around them when hurt. Not constantly as that would kill trees and affect biters badly.
- It should take a little bit of time for a player's corpse to turn into a Zombie. If other players remove all of the items from it before then, then no zombie is created. They are deemed to have dealt with the corpse.
- Add mod settings for:
    - Zombie health, speed and damage attack.
    - If the player's defences should auto target a zombie.
    - Frequency of graves across the map.
    - Probability of a grave containing a zombie.
    - Distance from spawn that the zombie starts to rampage.
    - Player detection range for a zombie.
    - Enable/Disable gravestones (default to on).
    - Probability of gravestone spawning a zombie.
+ Zombie should be immune to poison and slowdown capsules.
- When a zombie arises from a killed player or a gravestone have some graphical niceties.
- Add effects when a gravestone is destroyed.
- When a zombie with no player dies have its corpse colored the generic zombie color. As at present its the generic player character (orange) color. This will need a new corpse prototype to hard code the color there. Also name it as a zombie corpse, vs a player corpse. I think this will need/be cleanest if the default zombie color was set in the zombie prototype, but will still need to let the player color overwrite it if there was a player source. Not sure if this is possible, so might need to duplicate the default zombie color at data and runtime stages or something odd to handle all the variations and not upset base game.
- When a non-player zombie with no inventory dies have it create a regular corpse, not a character corpse. This can always be colored the same as the generic zombie color.
- If the "Doing Things By Hand" mod is present then check player's speed boost and apply this to Zombie's speed.



Unknowns / Undecided
--------------------
- If a Zombie kills a player what should happen. Either a new zombie appears and/or we could heal up and/or level up the victorious zombie.
- If a zombie is unable to reach a player for too long it should attack nearest player buildings. Effectively you can't just kite one forever or bounce them between 2 players going in and out of detection range.
- Should zombies have tougher versions that scale with evolution? Or maybe give them bonuses somehow? Quite possibly the other features will make up for this for player death zombies.
- At present graves are only destroyable (like biter eggs), should they be minable instead/as well?
- Should zombies be immune to static discharge defence?
- Zombies get faster at night time?



Future Ideas
------------
- When zombie fights and it has construction robots it will randomly place military stuff around it. This is the manifestation of hostile intent.
- Add camera window that tracks the zombie while it lives. See if another mod already does this that we can make use of. Include per player settings if they want this for their own zombie, all zombies or no zombies. Camera should be resizable, movable on the screen and minimisable.
- A list of active zombies and a map view jump to them. If we do camera feature link them together somehow? use shortcut option to toggle the list.
- Add remote interface to create zombie at arbitrary location and source player. Allow specifying equipment to give the zombie.
- Use the data on how many zombies a player has killed for some interesting thing?
- Support the standard player colors for Zombies. As can't directly color them, would need different prototypes for each color. This would have downsides in-game:
    - Kill lists would show different counts for each color. This could possibly be handled by making the entities not directly count and instead adding the kill via script reaction though the LuaFlowStatistics. This needs to be looked into, as there may be an in-game way to define a standard killed entity.
- Review known compatibility list and see what things we should start to handle.
- Add an interface to allow adding of random zombie names. So that they can be added from twitch chat somehow. Maybe include a way to clear the list as well. So that we can push the current twitch viewer names in as available options only.



Future Code
-----------
- Add a new utility to support scheduling nth tick events care free. So like event scheduler, where you can just add a function from a code module to be run at nth tick and not have to worry about other modules scheduling.
- Make a helper function that runs a callback function against each layer in an animation/sprite. Should handle if there are layers or not. Abstracting this from the player. Would make us support modded character graphics better.
- Review the LoggingUtils now as I think we have a lot of overlapping functions in there. This is a breaking changes utility version already in v1.0.0 of the Zombie mod.



Rejected
--------
- Doing the zombie as a `character` and control it by direct explicit action inputs. Experience with my exploration around an AI helper mod shows this will be very hard to do.
- No way to enable a player or player driven vehicle to be able to naturally or automatically target a zombie. As the only way to stop defences (turrets, combat robots, spidertrons, etc) from targetting Zombies was to make the player's force be in a cease fire towards them.



Known Capabilities
------------------
- Handles different surfaces.



Odd Notes
---------
- This code will generally soft error, rather than hard error. As it was rushed development this is to avoid breaking the server. However, it may leave Zombies in odd states sometimes, but they should print to screen and recover when a high priority activity occurs, i.e. a player goes near them.
