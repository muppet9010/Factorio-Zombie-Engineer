Required
--------
+ When player dies a zombie is created. The zombie gets the players inventory (meaning their corpse vanishes).
+ A zombie will have high health, be slow, and have a very high damage attack.
+ A zombie will be a `unit` and given explicit direct commands. It won't have any default behavior or reactions. We can't use generic behaviours, but should be able to do desired effect via explicit commands.
- A zombie should move towards the nearest player if they are within X distance (mod setting). This will need regular updating to both handle players running away fast (e.g. trains) and if the player moves the zombie will need to re-path towards their new position.
- A zombie should move towards the dead player's spawn if there is no near by player to target.
- If a zombie reaches within X distance (mod setting) of spawn it should then just target random player entities until a player comes within the detection range.
- A zombie should path towards its target smashing through anything in its direct way. The configurable options per pathfinder request are restricted within Factorio (to avoid affecting default biters). I believe doing a pathfinder request with a special entity that ignores entities should give the desired result path steps. We can then find the first target entity in the path and give our unit this as a target. The aim is to not slalom around buildings which the Factorio pathfinder will do by default.
+ A zombie should either be immune to belts. Alternative would be to view them as a blocking entity and destroy them.
+ A zombie should not be targeted by base defences or any automated fighting which isn't under player control, e.g. combat bots, spidertrons. A player will have to force shoot at the zombie, ideal for when they are in the base ^^
- Randomly add graves to the map. When mined/destroyed these will create zombies. Graphics from Rubble.


Nice To Have
------------
- Equip the players inventory for passive stuff to be active, e.g. power armor.
- Name the zombie after the player and their death number.
- When a player is killed by a zombie have an alert text and link to location saying who was killed by what zombie. As default Factorio would just list it as killed by zombie entity name.
- Add graphical effects to zombie so it stands out. Maybe odd colors, cloud of effects around it, etc.
- A zombie is friendly to biters, never destroying their stuff. Need to check how we path for this one.
- Zombies able to use player weapons to shoot other players and vehicles? Should always be a melee attack on buildings. Make mod setting to disable this. Will need to be a scripted attack as we can't change the units attack properties dynamically and replacing the entity based on weapon/ammo types would likely have unintended consequences.
- Zombies generate slow down and poison effects around them when hurt. Not constantly as that would kill trees and affect biters badly.
- It should take a little bit of time for a player's corpse to turn into a Zombie. If other players remove all of the items from it before then, then no zombie is created. They are deemed to have dealt with the corpse.
- Add mod settings for:
    - Zombie health, speed and damage attack.
    - If the player and their defences should auto target a zombie.
    - Frequency of graves across the map.
    - Probability of a grave containing a zombie.
- When a player kills a zombie, add an announcement that they have put the source player to rest. Also track how many zombies each player has killed internally (use o this is a future thing).


Unknowns / Undecided
--------------------
- When a player is controlling a vehicle should it automatically target the zombie. A player on foot does, a vehicle with no player doesn't. This may not be configurable independently in the end anyways. See when we get there.
- If a Zombie kills a player shat should happen. Either a new zombie appears or we could heal/level up the victorious zombie.
- If a zombie is unable to reach a player for too long it should attack nearest player buildings. Effectively you can't just kite one forever or bounce them between 2 players going in and out of detection range.


Future Ideas
------------
- When zombie fights and it has construction robots it will randomly place military stuff around it. This is the manifestation of hostile intent.
- Add camera window that tracks the zombie while it lives. See if another mod already does this that we can make use of. Include per player settings if they want this for their own zombie, all zombies or no zombies. Camera should be resizable, movable on the screen and minimisable.
- A list of active zombies and a map view jump to them. If we do camera feature link them together somehow? use shortcut option to toggle the list.
- Add remote interface to create zombie at arbitrary location and source player. Allow specifying equipment to give the zombie.
- Use the data on how many zombies a player has kills for some interesting thing.


Future Code
-----------
- Add a new utility to support scheduling nth tick events care free. So like event scheduler, where you can just add a function from a code module to be run at nth tick and not have to worry about other modules scheduling.
- Make a helper function that runs a callback function against each layer in an animation/sprite. Should handle if there are layers or not. Abstracting this from the player. Would make us support modded character graphics better.


Rejected
--------
- Doing the zombie as a `character` and control it by direct explicit action inputs. Experience with my exploration around an AI helper mod shows this will be very hard to do.
- No way to enable a player or player driven vehicle to be able to naturally or automatically target a zombie. As the only way to stop defences (turrets, combat robots, spidertrons, etc) from targetting Zombies was to make the player's force be in a cease fire towards them.


Known Limitations
-----------------
- It only handles the vanilla forces; player and enemy.
- It only handles vanilla character graphics.
- You can't force attack a target with your melee weapon (no ammo). So you have to use ammo to attack zombies.


Known Capabilities
------------------
- Handles different surfaces.
